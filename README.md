# Medicinal_Leaf_Recognition

This project is used to identify the leaf whether it is a medicinal or not. If it is medicinal it will provide the details of that leaf, other-wise it will be provide the closely matched result which is having accuracy more than 50%.
This project is developed using three models i.e., Resnet50, VGG15, InceptionV3 having accuracies of 96%, 93%, 86% respectively. 
Our workflow will be like, first it will extract the features of the leaf images which were given as input and the models recognizes the image and gives the output of the image, name, description with the obtained accuracies of each model.
This can be used as a real time project to identify, understand, and learn about a particular leaf by clicking the image and uploading it.
